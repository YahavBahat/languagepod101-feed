Explanation:

    Terminology:

    "-" - A string containing Roman numerals
    "_" - A number

    There are four strings or names which compose an entry's title which are hierarchically structured: Level, Season, Lesson, Part.

    Let's take this entry: 'Absolute Beginner Season 1 S1 #12 - Can You Eat This Japanese Meatloaf? - Dialog'

    Level name is the string before " S_", " Season _", ": ", or any number " _".
    In this case, Level name is be 'Absolute Beginner'

    Season name can be " S_", " S_ _", "Season _", and " _". or string beginning from ": " until " - ".
    Season name comes after Level name.
    In this case, Season name is be '1'

    Lesson name is the string after Level or Season name, beginning from " #_" until a " - " separator.
    In this case, Lesson name is be '#12 - Can You Eat This Japanese Meatloaf?'

    Part name is the name after Lesson name. It can be either "Part -" or "Part _".
    in this case, there is no Part name.

    Type name is the name after the last separator (" - "), it can be "Audio", "Video", "Lesson Notes", "Dialog", and more.
    Type names contains different content. For example "Lesson Notes" entries will contain a PDF file, while
    "Audio" and "Video" entries will contain different media files.
    In this case, the Type name is 'Dialog'

    If the entry contains more than one type of content, e.g., (PDF, Video and Audio) without a Type name in its title,
    we cannot distinguish between the types just by looking at the entry's title.
    In that case, each type will get its own directory inside of the entry folder, where the entry's content will be downloaded.
    For example:

    Absolute Beginner Season 1 S1 #12 - Can You Eat This Japanese Meatloaf?
    ├─ Audio
    ├─ Video
    ├─ PDF / Document

    However, if the entry name does contain a Type name, a folder will be created for each Type name.
    For example if we have those three entries:

    Absolute Beginner Season 1 S1 #12 - Can You Eat This Japanese Meatloaf? - Dialog
    Absolute Beginner Season 1 S1 #12 - Can You Eat This Japanese Meatloaf? - Video
    Absolute Beginner Season 1 S1 #12 - Can You Eat This Japanese Meatloaf? - Lesson Notes

    The final result will be:

    Absolute Beginner
    ├─ Season 1
        ├─ Lesson #12 - Can You Eat This Japanese Meatloaf?
            ├─ Dialog
            ├─ Video
            ├─ Lesson Notes
